# TASK DESCRIPTION:

         In today’s digitally driven world, productivity often hinges on how well we manage our time online. With the increasing number of distractions available through social media, streaming platforms, and various websites, it becomes essential to have a tool that can help users track, analyze, and improve their online habits. To address this need, I developed a Chrome Extension that automatically tracks the time spent on various websites and classifies them into productive and unproductive categories. The extension offers a simple but powerful dashboard that displays productivity insights through charts and summaries.

This project’s primary objective is to empower users to take control of their digital behavior by providing accurate data about their web activity. Whether the user is a student, professional, or casual browser, this extension enables them to reflect on their daily internet usage and make conscious changes to improve productivity.

The core functionality revolves around real-time tracking of browser tabs and active domains. Every time the user switches tabs or windows, the extension captures the time spent on each website. It then categorizes the website based on predefined classifications—such as productive (e.g., stackoverflow.com, github.com) or unproductive (e.g., youtube.com, instagram.com)—and stores the data locally in Chrome's storage system.

This time data is collected, aggregated, and presented in the form of a weekly report within the popup dashboard. The dashboard includes bar charts representing productive vs. unproductive minutes over the last 7 days and a top-sites summary that shows where the most time was spent. All this is done without needing a backend server, making the extension lightweight and privacy-focused.

In addition to its tracking capabilities, the extension also focuses on usability and simplicity. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and clean, using modern chart libraries and minimalistic layouts. When the user clicks on the extension icon in the toolbar, a dashboard immediately loads with real-time insights, requiring no manual input or complicated setup.

The extension also handles edge cases such as:

Switching tabs or windows

Leaving the browser idle

Categorizing unknown domains as neutral

Storing time data day-by-day for accurate reports

This project showcases the effective use of Chrome Extension APIs, including:

chrome.tabs for detecting active tab changes

chrome.windows for tracking focus

chrome.storage.local for persistent local data storage

Chart.js for clean, dynamic data visualization

In summary, this project is a full-fledged Chrome Extension that seamlessly blends time tracking, productivity classification, local data storage, and weekly analytics into a single tool. It is built with modular, clean JavaScript code and a user-friendly design that makes it suitable for personal use, academic submissions, or even as a base for more advanced productivity tools.
